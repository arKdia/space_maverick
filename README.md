-So far what we need to do-

GRAPHIC:	
		Images / Sound / Menu

ENEMIES:
		Change asteroid shape into enemy’s shape.
		Physics of ship destruction:
		  - how long will the enemy ship survive [how many collisions allowed]
		  - Positioning of ships: how to make enemy spawn and surround ship

RANDOM IDEAS:
- Player: have power ups

- Enemy ship: surround player using gravity towards player && force towards x
		
- Levels: 1st to 2nd level→ 1 ring of enemies ?
	   3rd level 	→ 3 rings of enemies ? 

- Game: have a radar on lower right corner

The one TRUE Tom Cruise simulator
