 please modify (syntax included) as needed to make the project design clearer)
 

-So far what we need to do-

GRAPHIC:	
		Images / Sound / Menu

ENEMIES:
		Change asteroid shape into enemy’s shape.
		Physics of ship destruction:
		  - how long will the enemy ship survive [how many collisions allowed]
		  - Positioning of ships: how to make enemy spawn and surround ship

RANDOM IDEAS:
- Player: have power ups

- Enemy ship: surround player using gravity towards player && force towards x
		
- Levels: 1st to 2nd level→ 1 ring of enemies ?
	   3rd level 	→ 3 rings of enemies ? 

- Game: have a radar on lower right corner

The one TRUE Tom Cruise simulator

=============================================================================================================================
So we should all go tomorrow to Gordon's lab and just put in some work on the project.
Note: I have made a header.h file that the project/game desperately needs and have added you all as contributors. The project works properly with the header file. So start adding your work to the repository I added you guys too.
This was done so that everyone can access the functions since I cannot and I really need to to upload and render pictures. 
See you guys tomorrow.
